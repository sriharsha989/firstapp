            "System and method for managing user equipment movement driven cell system load balancing. Network elements determine whether a user or user equipment in a first location is within a threshold distance of a second location of better coverage. Upon such a determination the network can provide a higher level of service. Location 110 a provides a first coverage/service-level 115 to the UE 110. At the location 110 b the user would have a second better coverage/ service-level 117 due to its proximity to the small cell eNB access node 140. Having poor reception in the intervening region 110 c (as illustrated by the poor bit rate/QoS at this point in FIG. 2) will discourage a user of the UE110 from moving from the locations 110 a to 110 b and thus prevents geographic load-balancing.\n",
