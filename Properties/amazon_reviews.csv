Your Gateway to Limitless Entertainment: Amazon Fire Stick","I have used Fire Sticks for quite a while.  Recently I learned that the peripheral cable boxes for Xfinity could be replaced with Fire Sticks and the Xfinity app.  Since they charge a monthly fee for all of these boxes it is a significant cost savings per year once the cost of the Fire Stick is deducted.  It is also a more streamlined installation (see photo of cable box installation on the left compared with Fire Stick for same service on the right).  A third advantage is the durability, ease of operation, and responsiveness of the Fire Stick compared with the Xfinity remotes.  We found that we were regularly replacing the Xfinity remotes and that newer versions did not have codes that allowed the remotes to control on-off or volume on the television.  Fire Sticks have never caused that problem.  The end result is a better engineered product at a significant cost savings.

Your Gateway to Limitless Entertainment: Amazon Fire Stick","I was totally flummoxed with a dysfunctional EVO PRO streaming device and was greatly relieved to get the Fire Stick to replace it. Took a little research to get it working with my sound bar but now all the functions are working smoothly (ute, volume, etc.). The remote is easy to learn, friendly to use and seems pretty sturdy. The device is nearly invisible plugged into the back of my TV. Have not delved into the Alexa voice control yet. So, initial impression after 2 days is very positive. Easy to set up and great on line resources to solve problems.  Very satisfied so far and hope my Fire Stick keeps working well.

Your Gateway to Limitless Entertainment: Amazon Fire Stick",The short of my personal recommendation is if you plan to use an Amazon Prime app get something else that has a different form of app. If you plan to use everything else then this is a good bit of hardware and software.,negative
