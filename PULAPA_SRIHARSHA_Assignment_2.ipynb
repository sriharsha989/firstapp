            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV.

I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2.

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it!

            "Review: This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.\n",

            "Review: This is a pretty cool Firestick. I mainly use it for streaming on YouTube, Vudu, and Netflix. It's the third one I've purchased... with every purchase, the designs get newer and more interesting. I love the power button that controls my tv, and the volume button that magically controls the tv as well... it's not a smart tv, but it does have HDMI ports x 2. Set-up was easy... just followed the instructions, linked my prior account, and it took it some time to get my apps on there, but it was eventually successful... did it all by itself!In case you don't know, or you've never owned a Firestick, the remote can be taken all the way across your house, and it'll still be able to work. You can hide it behind a pillow, and the signal is still strong. This is very interesting technology to me! On the other hand, I can take the manufactures (regular) remote and face it away from the tv, and it won't work! LOL!!! Oh! You get two AAA batteries to boot. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries with all of mine, and there's an on-screen prompt that notifies you when your batteries are running low. Pretty neat. (= I don't use voice recognition a lot, but most of the time, it works just fine. I refuse to invite Alexa into my humble home... for the time being. If she's hot enough, then I may reconsider.Technology is good depending on the intended application of it. At this point? My only concern is the longevity of this product. Had my first one, my very first one, not stopped working as expected (screens freezing, having to reset it multiple times to link with my Wi-Fi, mashing the button to the right required more muscle), then I'd have not been in the market for another. Nevertheless, all things eventually break down. In the meantime, this one is working just fine. 5 Stars.I hope this helps you with your purchase. Thanks for stopping by, and take care. Have a wonderful day!Z.\n",
